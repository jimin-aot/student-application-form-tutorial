2. **Fill Out the Demo Request Form**: On the form, you'll be asked to provide specific details:

   - **Application Title**: This will be displayed on the header of your application.

- **Login Credentials**: You will receive designer, client, and reviewer usernames, all prefixed with the acronym you chose (e.g., `jiminb-designer`).
- **Temporary Password**: A common password for initial login (e.g., `formsflow`).
- Links to a getting started guide and additional support.
