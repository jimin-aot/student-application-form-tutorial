## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through the process of requesting a demo from formsflow.ai, a Low Code Development Platform. By following these steps, you will gain access to a sandbox account to explore the platform's capabilities.

## Step 1: Requesting a Demo

1. **Visit the Demo Request Page**: Start by visiting [formsflow.ai's demo request page](https://formsflow.ai/try-it-now/).

2. **Fill Out the Demo Request Form**: On the form, you'll be asked to provide specific details:

   - **Application Title**: This will be displayed on the header of your application.
   - **Application Acronym**: This acronym will be part of your domain and account. Choose an acronym relevant to your project or organization.
   - **Preferred Hosting Option**: Select 'hosting by formsflow.ai'.
   - **Product Package Evaluation**: Choose 'community'.
   - Leave other fields empty unless specified.

   - Note: The options provided here are specifically for the purpose of this tutorial. Depending on your requirements or the context of your project, you may choose different options.

## Step 2: Receiving Confirmation and Account Details

After submitting the form, you will receive an email from `DoNotReply <dev@formsflow.ai>` confirming the creation of your sandbox account. The email will include:

- **Application URL**: A unique URL for your test instance.
- **Login Credentials**: You will receive a designer, client, and reviewer username, all prefixed with the acronym you chose (e.g., `jiminb-designer`).
- **Temporary Password**: A common password for initial login (e.g., `formsflow`).
- Links to a getting started guide and additional support.

## Step 3: First Login and Setting Up Your Account

1. **Access the Application URL**: Navigate to the application URL provided in the email.

2. **Login to Your Account**: Use the designer account (e.g., `jiminb-designer`) and the temporary password provided in the email to log in.

3. **Set Up a New Password**: Upon first login, you'll be prompted to set up a new password. This ensures the security of your account.
   - Note: The prefix 'jiminb' in the username is based on the 'Application Acronym' you chose during the demo request.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll have successfully set up a sandbox account with formsflow.ai, giving you the opportunity to explore and evaluate the platform. Remember, this is a test instance with limited functionality. Explore the various features and consider how formsflow.ai's Premium or Open Source versions can fit your business needs.
